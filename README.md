# Totally Accurate Weather

## Description
This web app was quite fun to develop, as it seems like the most practical one yet. It is designed to get up to three user
inputs (city, state, country) and to display the weather for the chosen city. Only the city name is required for this to operate
but using state (if applicable) and country can help refine results. The API will only return one city, so it will generally choose
the most populous city if you do not refine results. After the search is complete, it will display current weather details and a
5-day forecast for the given city. Also after each search, a button is dynamically generated to make seeing previous searches easier.
The city buttons are stored locally so data is persistent.

## Installation
